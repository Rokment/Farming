    <h2>Hello, I am Ibrahim. I had many plants in my house, but most of these plants do not live long. Then I was looking for a way to preserve the plants and I found this site. I started following the instructions written on the site and I benefited a lot. There are plants and species on this site that did not live long. After I followed the methods of how to preserve them, they lived for many months. Thank you very much for creating this wonderful and beautiful site.</h2>

     <h2>Hi, I am Omar. My father had a beautiful garden and he used to take care of his plants in the best possible way. A short time ago, my father passed away. I used to look at his garden and remember him every time. I made a promise to myself that I would take care of the garden for my father. At first, the situation was difficult and I started looking for ways to make it easier for me to take care of the plants. I found this site and I really liked the way it was coordinated, the view of the site and its beauty. Many thanks to those who created this site. Now I can take care of my father’s garden in the best possible way.</h2>

     <h2>Howdy, My name is Ali and I am a student at school. One day, the teacher asked us to take care of a plant for a week. She gave each of us a different type of plant. On the first day, I did not know how to take care of the plant, so I decided to search for the topic and found your site. I found the same plant that I have and applied all the advice there. After a week, I gave it to the teacher and she praised me and told me that I am one of the few students who took care of the plant in this way. In short, I really thank you. You helped me and now I feel that I care more about plants.</h1>
